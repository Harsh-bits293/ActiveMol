# ActiveMol
Protein Visualizer to visualize active sites of structurally characterized Metalloproteins
- **Project Overview**: ActiveMol is a Protein Visualizer that can help in viewing the active sites of Metalloproteins in 3D without any manual selections. The aim of this project is to develop a protein visualizer software that can visualize metal binding sites in a protein structure. The software is developed using Python programming language and DejaVu 3D graphics library. The protein structure information is obtained from PDB (Protein Data Bank) files, which are parsed using Biopython library. The user interface elements that allow the user to interact with the visualizations are implemented using PyQt5 library.  
- **Methodology**: The presence of metal atoms in the protein structure is determined by checking the elemental symbols of the atoms using the element symbol method. Other way to identify metal atoms information used is metal atom database. It provides information about the location of metal atoms in proteins and their coordination environment. 
- **Usage Instructions**: TBA later
- **Future Work**: Identify metal atoms in PDB using machine learning techniques. These techniques can be trained on a set of metal-containing proteins to recognize the characteristics of metal atoms in protein structures.
- **Contributions**: TBA later
